/// <para>
/// <b>Lazy construction.</b> The legacy <c>RollingFileLineWriter</c>
/// did not open the file or touch the filesystem at construction time
/// — the first <c>WriteLine</c> created the directory and opened the
/// stream. <see cref="FilesManager"/> is eager: its constructor opens
/// the active file. The shim restores the legacy timing by deferring
/// the <c>FilesManager</c> build until the first <c>WriteLine</c>, so
/// pipeline commits and configuration round-trips do not perform any
/// filesystem IO. That keeps tests that commit a v2 config without
/// also producing log events from accidentally writing to disk.
/// </para>

/// <para>
/// <b>Concurrency contract.</b> <c>WriteLine</c> is safe to call from
/// many threads — <see cref="LazyInitializer.EnsureInitialized{T}(ref T, ref bool, ref object, Func{T})"/>
/// gives the publish correct memory-model semantics on every
/// architecture (x86, ARM64). What is <i>not</i> safe is calling
/// <see cref="Dispose"/> concurrently with <c>WriteLine</c> on the
/// same instance: the active <see cref="FilesManager"/> reference is
/// single-owner and disposal nulls it. Callers must coordinate
/// disposal with their own quiescence (no in-flight writes) — the
/// sink lifecycle in <c>Herald.Sinks.File</c> already does this
/// because the pipeline drains before sinks are disposed.
